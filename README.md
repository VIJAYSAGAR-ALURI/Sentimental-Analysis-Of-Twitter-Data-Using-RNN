🧠 Sentimental Analysis Of Twitter Data Using RNN

A deep learning project for tweet sentiment and emotion classification using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). The system cleans text, maps emotions, predicts sentiment, applies confidence-based rules, and exports final results to CSV.


🎯 Project Overview

This model classifies tweets into both emotion categories (Happy, Sad, Angry, Relaxed, Excited, Fearful, etc.) and sentiment labels (Positive, Negative, Neutral).

It combines:

Deep learning based text classification

Emotion to sentiment mapping

Confidence-based fallback logic

⭐ Features

Automatic text cleaning and preprocessing

Auto-detect dataset tweet & label columns

RNN-based deep learning model

Rule-based logic for low-confidence predictions

Outputs Emotion + Sentiment + Confidence Score

Saves final analyzed results as CSV
